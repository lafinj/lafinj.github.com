## Bio

I'm a bench-to-bioinformatics researcher in the Strand Lab at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, TX. I leverage my background in biomedical research and expertise in single cell and spatial genomics to better understand the biology of the normal human lower urinary tract, informing investigations into diseases like bladder and prostate cancer and BPH. I also develop tools to help democratize single cell data and analysis pipelines.
